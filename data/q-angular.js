        question: 'What is Angular?',
        answer: `<strong>Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular
                            includes:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
                            <li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features,
                                including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
                            </li>
                            <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code</li>
                        </ul>`,
    },
    {
        question: 'What are some of the advantages of Angular over other frameworks?',
        answer: `<ul>
                            <li>Features that are provided out of the box - Angular provides a number of built-in
                                features like routing, state management, rxjs library and http servicesstraight out of
                                the box. This means that one does not need to look for the above-stated features
                                separately. They are all provided with angular.
                            </li>
                            <li>Declarative UI - Angular uses HTML to render the UI of an application. HTML is a
                                declarative language and is much easier to use than JavaScript.
                            </li>
                            <li>Long-term Google support - Google announced Long-term support for Angular. This means
                                that Google plans to stick with Angular and further scale up its ecosystem.
                            </li>
                        </ul>`,
    },
    {
        question: 'What are templates in Angular?',
        answer: ` <strong>A template is a kind of HTML that instructs Angular about how to display a component.</strong> An Angular HTML template, like conventional HTML, produces a view, or user interface, in the browser, but with far more capabilities. Angular API evaluates an HTML template of a component, creates HTML, and renders it.`,
